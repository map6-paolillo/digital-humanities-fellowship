### For Reference

#### OpenRefine Resources

[Official OpenRefine Documentation](http://openrefine.org/documentation.html)  
[Getting started with OpenRefine](http://thomaspadilla.org/dataprep/) by Thomas Padilla (A thorough introduction and reference. Geared toward humanists; the example data set is a list of books.)  
[Cleaning Data with OpenRefine](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) by Seth van Hooland, Ruben Verborgh and Max De Wilde (A peer-reviewed tutorial published by The Programming Historian)  
[Understanding Clustering Methods](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth) (If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of how different clustering methods work.)  
[Reference for GoogleRefine Expression Language (GREL)](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-Functions). Dictionary of GREL functions and how to use them -- when you are ready to do more complex pattern searching.  
[GREL Recipes](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Recipes). If there's something you want to do with GREL and you can't figure how to do it, check here. 


#### Geocoding Services for Contemporary Addresses

[Texas A&M Geocoding Service](http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/). U.S.Addresses only. 2500 addresses at a time for free. Can easily add more sets of 2500 credits.

The [MMQGIS](http://michaelminn.com/linux/mmqgis/) plug-in for [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/). [[How To](https://www.gislounge.com/how-to-geocode-addresses-using-qgis/)]. Calls on either the Google geocoder (limit of 2500 addresses per day) or on Nomantium/Open Street Map (no limit on number of addresses). Global addresses.

Your Carto account gives you 250 free address geocodes per month. Global coverage, but quality varies. 

#### Place Name Gazetteers, Historic and Contemporary

[The Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/)  
(For visual studies, see also: [Art and Architecture Thesaurus Online](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/))  

[GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/)  

[Peripleo](https://peripleo.pelagios.org/), a gazetteer of "places of the past"

[Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/), a gazetteer of ancient places

How to make your own gazetteer for place-name extraction with Python:
