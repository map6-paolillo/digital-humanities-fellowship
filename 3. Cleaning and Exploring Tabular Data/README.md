#### OpenRefine Resources

[Cleaning Data with OpenRefine](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine), a tutorial on *Programming Historian*

[Guide to GREL](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-Functions) (Google Refine Expression Language) GREL is a sibling of regular expressions.

#### Geocoding Services for Contemporary Addresses

[Texas A&M Geocoding Service](http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/). U.S.Addresses only. 2500 addresses at a time for free. Can easily add more sets of 2500 credits.

The [MMQGIS](http://michaelminn.com/linux/mmqgis/) plug-in for [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/). [[How To](https://www.gislounge.com/how-to-geocode-addresses-using-qgis/)]. Calls on either the Google geocoder (limit of 2500 addresses per day) or on Nomantium/Open Street Map (no limit on number of addresses). Global addresses.

Your Carto account gives you 250 free address geocodes per month. Global coverage, but quality varies.
