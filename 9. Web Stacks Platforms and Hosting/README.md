# Day 9 -- The Web Stack, Platforms, & Hosting

## Choosing a Host 
#### Two options
1. Lease your own space. Have full access to the back end. Install whatever you want there.  
  * In most cases, I recommend [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/shared-hosting/). It's designed for scholars, has fantastic technical support, and makes it really easy to install your own instance(s) of Wordpress, Omeka, Scalar, mySQL, and many more platforms. You can also start from scratch and host any HTML, CSS, and/or JS that you write (or borrow/adapt) here. Security and back ups are covered for you. You can register any domain name you like (or move an existing one over). Cost for a personal plan is $30/year. 
  * In a few cases you might want to install something that Reclaim doesn't support easily. One example is PostGIS, a spatial relational database software. In that case you would need to get some developer cloud space at a host like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).  
  
2. Use some of the the CoLab's space.  
  * The CoLab has an organizational account through Reclaim (100 GB). If you're not ready to buy your own space, or you just want a temporary space to experiement, you can use some of it for your own installation of Omeka, Scalar, Wordpress, or another software package. The domain You won't have your own access to the backend of the server itself (so you can't write your code from scratch), but you *can* access the back end of whatever software installation you have are using, and if/when you're ready to migrate it over to your own Reclaim (or other) space, you can. The domain name will be cornellcolab.net. 
  * CoLab space is also a good solution if you're teaching a class and your students need space for their projects. (See undergrad examples below.) You can talk to Eliza anytime about getting space for student assignments. 

## Omeka/Neatline
Omeka really shines in its ability to manage collections of archival objects (including photos, audio, and video), and to create exhibitions from them. 

* [The Hereford Map](http://historiacartarum.org/john-mandeville-and-the-hereford-map-2/what-are-you/)
* [Showcase of Omeka Projects](http://info.omeka.net/showcase/)

[Neatline](http://neatline.org) is a sophisticated plugin for Omeka that allows mapping. Check out some of the example projects made with Neatline, and compare with Carto. One difference between the two is that Omeka allows much more freeform annotation, and various ways of embedding collections of objects within the map. Neatline also offers timeline tools.

Omeka.net is the hosted version of Omeka. Anyone may create a small Omeka.net project for free (with limited plugins).  
Cornell has an institutional subscription to Omeka.net, which allows for more storage space and plugins. You're welcome to create a site on Cornell's Omeka.net instance. Email Eliza with the domain name you want to use. (_______.omeka.net)

However, Omeka.net does not support Neatline, so if you want to use it, you'll have to host your own installation Omeka (Omeka.org), using server space at Reclaim Hosting or elsewhere. 

For Omeka usage instructions, see: *The Programming Historian*'s [Up and Running with Omeka.net](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka)

Note: Omeka can be a great pedagogical tool, in part because the interface is so simple to use. If you'd like to see some fantastics FWS projects built with Omeka, let Eliza know. Unfortunately they're not public because they use copyrighted material, but I'd be glad to show them to you.

**As you explore the projects, please keep the following guiding questions in mind:**


* What kind of projects would be a good fit for the features of this platform?
* Can you identify the type(s) of data/metadata being used? 
* In how many ways is the data made available to others? (For instance, how might a researcher download the data to use in a new project?)
* If you imagine this project in the coming years (decades?), what might be problems that come up over time? Are there areas of concern for sustainability?
* Where would your project be hosted (and by whom?) if you used this platform? Who has ownership, control, rights?
* How "safe" is your data here? Does the platform allow you to protect your data in some fashion?
* Is it possible to truly restrict access? Or is it security by obscurity?
