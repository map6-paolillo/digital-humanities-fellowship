# SGFDH Day 9 -- Platforms and Infrastructure
Platforms, Publishing, Hosting

For our session today, we will explore published Digital Humanities projects in pairs and compare the features of various popular platforms. Please select a project from the list below:

## Omeka/Neatline
Omeka really shines in its ability to manage collections of archival objects (including photos, audio, and video), and to create exhibitions from them. 

* [The Hereford Map](http://historiacartarum.org/john-mandeville-and-the-hereford-map-2/what-are-you/)
* [Showcase of Omeka Projects](http://info.omeka.net/showcase/)

[Neatline](http://neatline.org) is a sophisticated plugin for Omeka that allows mapping. Check out some of the example projects made with Neatline, and compare with Carto. One difference between the two is that Omeka allows much more freeform annotation, and various ways of embedding collections of objects within the map. Neatline also offers timeline tools.

Omeka.net is the hosted version of Omeka. Anyone may create a small Omeka.net project for free (with limited plugins).  
Cornell has an institutional subscription to Omeka.net, which allows for more storage space and plugins. You're welcome to create a site on Cornell's Omeka.net instance. Email Eliza with the domain name you want to use. (_______.omeka.net)

However, Omeka.net does not support Neatline, so if you want to use it, you'll have to host your own installation Omeka (Omeka.org), using server space at Reclaim Hosting or elsewhere. 

For Omeka usage instructions, see: *The Programming Historian*'s [Up and Running with Omeka.net](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka)

Note: Omeka can be a great pedagogical tool, in part because the interface is so simple to use. If you'd like to see some fantastics FWS projects built with Omeka, let Eliza know. Unfortunately they're not public because they use copyrighted material, but I'd be glad to show them to you.

**As you explore the projects, please keep the following guiding questions in mind:**


* What kind of projects would be a good fit for the features of this platform?
* Can you identify the type(s) of data/metadata being used? 
* In how many ways is the data made available to others? (For instance, how might a researcher download the data to use in a new project?)
* If you imagine this project in the coming years (decades?), what might be problems that come up over time? Are there areas of concern for sustainability?
* Where would your project be hosted (and by whom?) if you used this platform? Who has ownership, control, rights?
* How "safe" is your data here? Does the platform allow you to protect your data in some fashion?
* Is it possible to truly restrict access? Or is it security by obscurity?
