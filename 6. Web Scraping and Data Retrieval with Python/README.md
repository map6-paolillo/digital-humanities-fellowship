# SGFDH-Day-6-Web-scraping
Fetch, transform, and output website data with Python

For today's lesson, please download the Notebook file Day6Notebook.ipynb. This may behave a little strangely on GitHub. For instance, I had to click on the file in the repository, click the Raw link, and then use the Save Page As... option in my browser to save the file to my desktop.

Once you've downloaded the notebook, log in to [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) and create an account with your Cornell NetID. 

Create a new repository, such as "SGFDH Code".

Finally, upload Day6Notebook.ipynb to your account. We will be working off of this notebook in today's session.
