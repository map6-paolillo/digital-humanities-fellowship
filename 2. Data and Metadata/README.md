# SGFDH Day 2: Metadata

### Prep Assignment 

Please bring a hat to the session today. (If you do not own a hat, consider borrowing one, or simply bringing any accessory that can be worn on your head.)  The hat might have an origin story that you wouldn't mind sharing in class, or can be completely utilitarian.  Increased diversity of headgear will make this exercise the most meaningful, so the more unusual, the better. 

#### Optional Prep Reading

*Wikipedia*'s entry on [Musical Instrument Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument_classification)

Dooley, D.M., Griffiths, E.J., Gosal, G.S. et al. FoodOn: a harmonized food ontology to increase global food traceability, quality control and data integration. npj Sci Food 2, 23 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-018-0032-6  (See especially Figure 3)

### After the Session

#### Optional Post-Session Reading
[The TaDiRAH](https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH) (Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities)  
The TaDiRAH was an effort to provide an ontology for all the different research activities and objects that a digital humanist might work on or with. *Read the README and Introduction files for background information, and the "reading" folder for the actual taxonomy.*

#### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* Does your data have metadata? Do you need to create metadata or additional metadata?
* What metadata might be useful or necessary for you to perform the anlysis and/or create the interface that you plan?
* What do you wish you understood better?
* Anything you learned today that was useful?
