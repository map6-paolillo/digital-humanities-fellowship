# SGFDH Day 2: Metadata

### Prep Assignment 

Please bring an object from home to the session today. The object can be decorative, functional, historical, or contemporary. Ideally, it will have some sort of significance to you or a background story (that you feel comfortable describing in class!). 

#### Optional Prep Reading
Wallack, Jessica Seddon, and Ramesh Srinivasan. "Local-global: Reconciling mismatched ontologies in development information systems." 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences. IEEE, 2009. [Copy in the Illinois institutional repository](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/15202/WallackSrinivasanICONF091.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y). 

*Wikipedia*'s entry on [Musical Instrument Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument_classification)

### After the Session

#### Optional Post-Session Reading
[The TaDiRAH](https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH) (Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities)  
TaDiRAH was an effort to provide an ontology for all the different research activities and objects that a digital humanist might work on or with.  
Read the README and Introduction files for background information, and the "reading" folder for the actual taxonomy. 

#### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* Does your data have metadata? Do you need to create metadata or additional metadata?
* What metadata might be useful or necessary for you to perform the anlysis and/or create the interface that you plan?
* What do you wish you understood better?
* Anything you learned today that was useful?
