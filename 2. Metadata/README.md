### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* Does your data have metadata? Do you need to create metadata or additional metadata?
* What metadata might be useful or necessary for you to perform the anlysis and/or create the interface that you plan?
* What do you wish you understood better?
* Anything you learned today that was useful?
