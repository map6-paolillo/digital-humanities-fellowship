# SGFDH-Day2-Metadata
Metadata Librarian Jenn Colt will join us for this discussion.

Here's a list of [links and resources](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2192925/dhmetadata2018/items) (in a Zotero page) that Jenn references.

You can download her PowerPoint presentation from the Day 2 repository. 

### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* Does your data have metadata? Do you need to create metadata or additional metadata?
* What metadata might be useful or necessary for you to perform the anlysis and/or create the interface that you plan?
* What do you wish you understood better?
* Anything you learned today that was useful?

### Prepare for Tomorrow
