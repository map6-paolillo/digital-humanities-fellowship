* [Topic Modeling and Figurative Language by Lisa M. Rhody](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-and-figurative-language-by-lisa-m-rhody/)

Here's two applications of topic modeling that fellows may be interested in looking at:

## After this session

Please start the free [Python 2 Course on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python). Try to put an hour or two into the training, but don't worry about completing the course. We will start from the beginning in Monday's session, but having some hands-on experience will give us a running start.
